# 8086 Instruction Decoder

This is my solution to Casey Muratori's assignment from Performance-Aware Programming. The main goal of this project is to learn more about how CPUs work, so that I can be more in touch with how the code I write gets executed.

## How

Accepts 16-bit binary instructions for the Intel 8086 and decodes it into Assembly.

Usage:
```./main <binary file>```
